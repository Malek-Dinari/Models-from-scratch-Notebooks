# Models-from-scratch-Notebooks
I just created a mini gpt-like (text decoding) model. Will add my NN, ANN and CNN implementations very soon. Currently learning and expanding my knowledge when it comes to RNN (LSTM) as well as the newer state-of-the-Art architectures like Bert encoders and multi head and cross attention transformers and generative  LLMs.

*Currently* updating the **development** branch with the trained mini gpt. 
*Goal*:  make it suitable and good enough  for question answering and text summarization (simple language model) + then fine-tune it to answer for more real-world problems
